// The ChannelTree's primary purpose is to allocate DCH channels
// from the pool for a SF chosen to meet a bandwidth criteria.
// DESIGN:
// The channels are in a tree, where each level is called a tier,
// with 4 channels at tier 0 (SF=4) and 256 channels at tier 7 (SF=256).
// We assume that we are going to allocate DCH physical channel objects to populate
// the entire tree on startup by the chPopulate() method.
//
// CHANNEL ALLOCATION:
// Use the chChooseByBW() or chChooseBySF() methods to allocate a DCH channel.
// It is dynamic, so you can mix and match SF, no restrictions except what is intrinsic.
// There is no data stored in this structure about which channels are active,
// rather it calls the phChAllocated() method from the channel each time.
// So when a channel is deallocated, nothing is done in this tree at all.
// The chChoose functions currently open the channel before returning to make sure
// there is no race between two threads trying to allocate channels simultaneously.
// Dont know if that is possible because the callers dont yet exist :-)
// It is the callers responsibility to close the channel when finished.
//
// RESERVATIONS:
// Each physical channel that is used for some purpose other than a DCH
// must be reserved in the tree by chReserve() prior to calling chPopulate()
// I added chReserve() calls to the RACH and FACH classes, but make darned sure
// you also call it for PICH, or whatever.
// And I quote, from 25.213 5.2.1:
// "The channelisation code for the Primary CPICH is fixed to C(ch,256,0)
// "and the channelisation code for the Primary CCPCH is fixed to C(ch,256,1).
// "The channelisation codes for all other physical channels are assigned by UTRAN."
// That implies that channel 0 is unusable in all tiers of the tree.
// Additionally, there are going to be some SCCPCH (for FACH and PCH),
// then we will fill the rest of the tree with DPDCH.
//
// QUALITY OF SERVICE:
// The bandwidth criteria comes from the QoS [Quality of Service] IE
// in the L3 PDP Context Setup message.
// In GPRS, I never saw anything but 'best effort' so we may have to
// map 'best effort' to something else, probably minimal effort.
// The bandwidth criteria in the QoS includes mean and peak throughputs,
// and an astonishing amount of other largely irrelevant information that
// mostly has to do with allocating capacity upstream.
// I assume we are only interested in peak throughput.
// The Peak bandwidth is discreetized into 9 classes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 KB/s.
// (That's KiloBytes/s, not Kilobits/s.)  This does not exactly match the available bandwidth for
// our 7 available SF (SF=4 to SF=256) so we are going to be a little sloppy about that and
// just say that 256KB/s maps to SF=4, and so on down, so the bottom three tiers (1,2,4KB/s)
// all map to a SF=256 channel with a nominal bandwidth of 30kbs = 3.75KB/s
